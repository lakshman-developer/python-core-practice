# Strings Practice
# A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
# You can use single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ") to create a string.
# Triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """) can be used for multi-line strings.
# Example of multi-line string:
from pydoc import text


multi_line_string = """My name is Lakshman.
I love programming.
My favorite programming language is Python."""
print(multi_line_string)

# String Indexing
# You can access individual characters in a string using indexing.
# Indexing starts at 0 for the first character.
Text = "Hello World"
# H starts at index 0, e is at index 1, l is at index 2, and so on.
# Space also counts as a character and is at index 5.
print(Text[0])  # Output: H
print(Text[6])  # Output: W
# If we try to access an index that is out of range, we will get index error.
# print(Text[20])  # This will raise an IndexError

# Negative Indexing
# You can also use negative indexing to access characters from the end of the string.
# Last chracter is at index -1, second last is at index -2, and so on.
print(Text[-1])  # Output: d
print(Text[-2])  # Output: l

# String Slicing
# You can extract a substring from a string using slicing.
# The syntax for slicing is: string[start:end:step].
# start is the index where the slice starts (includes the start index).
# end is the index where the slice ends (does not include the end index).
# step is the number of characters to skip (optional).
# Example of slicing:
print(Text[0:5])  # Output: Hello
print(Text[6:11])  # Output: World
# string[:] will give you whole string
print(Text[:])  # Output: Hello World
print(Text[:4]) # Starts from index 0 and ends at index 4 (does not include index 4).
print(Text[6:]) # Starts from index 6 and goes till the end of the string.
# You can also use negative indices in slicing.
print(Text[-5:])  # Output: World
print(Text[:-6])  # Output: Hello

# Strings are immutable.
# This means that you cannot change a string after it has been created.
# If you try to change a character in a string, you will get a TypeError.

# len() function can be used to find the length of a string.
print(len(Text))  # Output: 11

# String Concatenation
# You can concatenate (combine) two or more strings using the + operator.
first_name = "Lakshman"
last_name = "Valeti"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: Lakshman Valeti

# String Repetition
# You can repeat a string multiple times using the * operator.
message = "Hi"
print(message * 3) # Output: HiHiHi

# Membership operator
# You can check if a substring is present in a string using the in operator.
s = "Python"
print("th" in s)
# You can check if a substring is not present in a string using the not in operator.
print("z" not in s) # Output: True
